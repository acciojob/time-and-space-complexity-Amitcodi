	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. An algorithm is considered efficient if it has a low time complexity, meaning it can handle large inputs in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is important to consider both time and space when evaluating an algorithm. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
